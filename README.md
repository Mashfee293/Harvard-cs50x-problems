   #1 scrabble --> this is a word game there are points per letter. it prompt the user two times once for player-1 and another     time for player-2.
   #2 readability --> after running the code it will prompt user for a text and then it will return the level of complexcity       according to US grading system.
   #3 caeser --> You have to run the program with command line argument which will be the key and it will detrmine how many       charecter you want to switch from plain to cipher text.then you input the plain text and it will return the cipher text.
   #4 substitute --> This program is similer to caeser. you have to write down throughly inthe place of command line argument.    for example if you want to substitute A with G and B with Y you wil write like GY..... .
